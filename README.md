## Change detection in hyperspectral images (HSIs) using untrained models with feature augmentation strategies

The proposed method provides a novel untrained framework using randomly initialized models with spatial-channel augmentation for HSI change detection

**To run the code** please download the datasets and put them in datasets folder.<br/>
Then cd to deepImagePriorNonlinear_RICD directory and run the code by using following command:  <br/>
python deepImagePriorSantaBarbara.py <br/>
